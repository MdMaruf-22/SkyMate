This is a simple weather forecasting software(I didnt implement the other things except weather.Maybe later :) ) using OpenWeather API( https://openweathermap.org/ ).You can see any cities weather of any country supported by OpenWeather.Currently it supports only two languages(Spanish and English).You can also save any cities as favourite.I followed the MVC(Mode-Controller-View) model here.
